Revision history for Posy-Plugin-FileStats
==========================================

0.5002 Tue 08 February 2005
---------------------------

  * (8 Feb 2005) fixed bug with directories
  	At one point, it kept on trying to add the root directory
  to it's file statistics.  So now it checks defensively.

0.5001 Sun 06 February 2005
---------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) fix for non-existant files
  	If one is doing a partial reindex, one really needs to check
  if the files exist, or you'll try to get stats for something that's not
  there.

0.50 Sun 06 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) more selective reindexing
    - full reindex is only done (a) if there are no cache data files
      or (b) if the 'reindex' parameter is true.
    - new 'reindex_cat' parameter will force a partial reindex; just of
      the given category.
    - new 'delindex' parameter will force a check for non-existant files
      and delete them from the index.
    - if a file is in the global indexs (files/others), and it's not in
      this index, then will add its stats to this index.

  * (6 Feb 2005) added INSTALLATION docs

  * (5 Feb 2005) removed Makefile.PL

  * (5 Feb 2005) word count in HTML body

0.40 Sat 15 January 2005
------------------------

  * (15 Jan 2005) splitting out from Posy core
