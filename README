==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::FileStats - Posy plugin to cache file statistics


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::FileStats.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This is a "utility" plugin to be used by other plugins; it maintains a list
(and cache) of file statistics in $self->{file_stats} which can be used by
other plugins (such as Posy::Plugin::LinkSized).

It provides an action method "index_file_stats" which should be put after
"index_entries" in the action list.

The file_stats hash is referenced by the full name of the file.

The statistics kept are:

size
The size of the file in bytes.

size_string
The size of the file as a string (with K or M as appropriate).

mime_type
The MIME type of the file.

mtime
For convenience, copies the mtime from $self->{files} or $self->{others} for
the given file.

word_count
The word-count of text and HTML files.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Posy
    Posy::Core
